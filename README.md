# SM213_CPU
This project simulates the Fetch and Execute stages of the CPU cycle, and the `MainMemory` class, which abstracts memory operations including allocation, alignment checks, and byte-to-integer conversions. 'CPU' class simulates a single cycle execution of an actual computer. Together, they provide a complete simulation framework for the SM213 architecture, handling CPU operations and memory management.
